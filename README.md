## Javascript Tutorial

This repo is a javascript & html tutorial.

To get started:

- Start a local http server on your machine with `./run`
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

To start developing, let's get 3 things open:
- the browser development console; once you're on the page, right-click on any element on the page and select *Inspect *
- Open `index.html` in your editor
- Open `static/include.js` in your editor

When you make edits to the files above, reload the page to see them (and view the browser console)!
